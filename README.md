# Human-Activity-Recognition

#### Machine Learning in scikit-learn for human activity recognition

#### The data

+ 8 labelled sequences corresponding to 8 different individuals performing a set of activities (running, walking, standing, sitting, lying) in seminaturalistic conditions
+ Sampling frequency: 16 Hz
+ 8-dimensional signals (accelerometer z and x&y axes, a 3-axes gyroscope)
+ Less than 20 min recordings
+ The data is already pre-processed
+ 2 unlabelled sequences

#### The goal

+ To infer the activity performed in the 2 unlabelled sequences
